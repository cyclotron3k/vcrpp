Full 8-digit VCRplus+ decode/encode code enclosed.

The first "release" of this is at <http://www.cryptome.org/vcrpp.c>.

Since then, I've fixed one bug, put in some efficiency changes and
added some proper inverse functions in place of the brute force
loops.  And transliterated it (badly) to Perl, with a PerlTk GUI.

I've also noted that - according to Google - the cryptome posting
has gotten basically no notice.

So I'm sending a couple of floppies to people who had some comments
on VCRPP a decade ago and for whome I can find a likely postal
address.

Please pass it on and/or post it to usenet or the web if you
feel like it.  My only intent is to get this code out where it'll
be archived and available.

Thanks,
